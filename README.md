# nav-portfolio

# Welcome to my Portfolio !
In this application, when the portfolio is loaded, then the user is presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them. Also, when the links in the navigation are clicked, then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. When the links to the section about their work is clicked on, then the UI scrolls to a section with a titled image of the developer's work.
Lastly, when the images of applications are clicked on, then the user is taken to that deployed application. Overall this is very useful to get hired by employers.
